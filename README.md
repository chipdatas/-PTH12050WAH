Cin = 100 µF, Cout = 0 µF SPECIFICATIONS
The PTH12050 is a next generation series of non-isolated dc-dc converters offering
some of the most advanced POL features available in the industry. The primary new
feature provides for sequencing between multiple modules, a function, which is
becoming a necessity for powering advanced silicon including DSP’s, FPGA’s and
ASIC’s requiring controlled power-up and power-down Other industry leading features
include efficiencies up to 93%. The PTH12050 has an input voltage of 10.8 Vdc to
13.2 Vdc and offers a wide output voltage range adjustable with external trim resistor,
allowing for maximum design flexibility and a pathway for future upgrades.

Notes 1 Remote ON/OFF. Positive Logic
ON: Pin 3 open; or V > Vin - 0.5 V
OFF: Pin 3 GND; or V < 0.8 V (min - 0.2 V).
2 See Figure 1 for safe operating curve.
3 A 100 µF electrolytic input capacitor is required for proper operation. The
capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 750 mA rms of ripple current.
C2 = 10 µF ceramic capacitor, required for output voltages of 3.3 V and
higher.
4 An external output capacitor is not required for basic operation. Adding
100 µF of distributed capacitance at the load will improve the transient
response.
5 1 A/µs load step, 50 to 100% Iomax, Cout = 100 µF. 6 If utilized Vout will track applied voltage by ±0.3 V (up to Vo set point).
7 Tape and reel packaging only available on the surface-mount versions.
8 The pk-pk output ripple voltage is measured with an external 10µF
ceramic capacitor. See Figure 3 Standard application schematic.
9 To order Pb-free (RoHS compatible) surface-mount parts replace the
mounting option ‘S’ with ‘Z’, e.g. PTH12050WAZ. To order Pb-free
(RoHS compatible) through-hole parts replace the mounting option ‘H’
with ‘D’, e.g. PTH12050WAD.

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who
select the PTH12050. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules
in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed
in a range of 1.2 V to 5.5 V for suffix ‘-W’ and 0.8 V to 1.8 V for suffix ‘-L’.
When the PTH12050 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted
to the default voltage of 1.2 V for the PTH12050W and 0.8V for the
PTH12050L.
